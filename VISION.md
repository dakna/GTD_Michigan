## Drew's Vision

This app will implement the 5 steps outlined in David Allen's book *[Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)*: Capture, Process, Organize, Review, Engage. I think the main focus of the app is to make it as fast as possible to capture any particular to-do as fast as possible. I think this can be done by always showing the (+) fab button, and eventually adding a homescreen widget that opens up into the 'capture new task' screen.
